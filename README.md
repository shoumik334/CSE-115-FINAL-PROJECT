## Kasundi Online Restaurant Management System

This project is an Online Restaurant Management System developed in C. The system allows customers to register, log in, choose from a menu of food items, place orders, and make payments. The system handles both new customers (with a registration process) and returning customers (with a login process).

### Features

- **User Registration**: New customers can create an account with a unique username and password.
- **User Login**: Existing customers can log in with their credentials.
- **Food Menu**: Customers can browse the menu and order various food items like burgers, noodles, biriyani, and fried rice.
- **Order Management**: Customers can add multiple items to their cart, view the total bill, and proceed to payment.
- **Payment Methods**: Multiple payment options are available, including Bkash, Rocket, Credit Card, and Cash on Delivery.
- **Clear User Interface**: The system uses a simple and easy-to-understand command-line interface with prompts and messages to guide users.



The system will start, and you can interact with the menu to place an order.
